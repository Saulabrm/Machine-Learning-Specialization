    "1. Which of the following is NOT a valid measure of overfitting?\n",
    " - Sum of parameters\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In ridge regression, choosing a large penalty strength λ tends to lead to a model with (choose all that apply):\n",
    " - High bias, Low Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which of the following plots best characterize the trend of bias, variance, and generalization error (all plotted over λ)?\n",
    " - 3rd\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In ridge regression using unnormalized features, if you double the value of a given feature (i.e., a specific column of the feature matrix), what happens to the estimated coefficients for every other feature? They:\n",
    " - Impossible to tell from the information provided\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If we only have a small number of observations, K-fold cross validation provides a better estimate of the generalization error than the validation set method.\n",
    " - True\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. 10-fold cross validation is more computationally intensive than leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation.\n",
    " - False\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Assume you have a training dataset consisting of N observations and D features. You use the closed-form solution to fit a multiple linear regression model using ridge regression. To choose the penalty strength λ, you run leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation searching over L values of λ. Let Cost(N,D) be the computational cost of running ridge regression with N data points and D features. Assume the prediction cost is negligible compared to the computational cost of training the model. Which of the following represents the computational cost of your LOO cross validation procedure?\n",
    " - L* N * Cost(N-1,D)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Assume you have a training dataset consisting of 1 million observations. Suppose running the closed-form solution to fit a multiple linear regression model using ridge regression on this data takes 1 second. Suppose you want to choose the penalty strength λ by searching over 100 possible values. How long will it take to run leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation for this selection task?\n",
    " - 3 years\n",

    "9. Assume you have a training dataset consisting of 1 million observations. Suppose running the closed-form solution to fit a multiple linear regression model using ridge regression on this data takes 1 second. Suppose you want to choose the penalty strength λ by searching over 100 possible values. If you only want to spend about 1 hour to select λ, what value of k should you use for k-fold cross-validation?\n",
